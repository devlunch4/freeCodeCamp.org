# What is Numpy?

- 1D array
- 2D array
- 3D array

# How are Lists different from Numpy?

- Lists : Slow
- Numpy : Fast

# Why is Numpy Fater?
- Faster to read less bytes of memory
- No type checking when iteratin through objects

# How are Lists different from Numpy?
- Lists
  - Insertion, deletion, appending, concatenation, etc.
  - a = [ 1, 2, 5 ]
  - b = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
  - a*b = ERROR

- NumPy
  - Insertion, deletion, appending, concatenation, etc.
  - a = np.array([ 1, 3, 5 ])
  - b = np.array([ 1, 2, 3 ])
  - a*b = np.array([ 1, 6, 15])

#Applications of NumPy?
  - Mathematics (MATLAB Replacement)
  - Plotting (Matplotlib)
  - Backend (Pandas, Connect 4, Digital Photography)
  - Machine Learning
